= Kubernetes and You

Two part tutorial, GKE and bare metal node running on Vagrant.

=== Local setup.

We need to attempt to speed up the download and so we want to point our Docker downloads at a local cache, along as allowing us to
push them to a local repository. 

Please modify your Docker Daemon - if you are running on Linux, edit /etc/default/docker. 

If running on MacOS 10 (X) please edit /var/lib/boot2docker/profile - edit the EXTRA_ARGS

----
EXTRA_ARGS='--label provider=vmwarefusion --insecure-registry=192.168.1.134:5001 --registry-mirror=http://192.168.1.134:5000'
----

Just add the --insecure-registry and --registry-mirror

Typically you can restart with:

----
sudo /etc/init.d/docker restart
----

If you are on systemd you are on your own.

=== GKE setup

You need to ensure that you have the Google Cloud Tools API installed and gcloud init run. We will set up a new project for this
walk through.
